    <h1><strong>Welcome to the Cat Pantry!</strong></h1>
      <p> My ladies are getting older and got some sensitive tummies. That's why grain-free products with low mineral content are my priority when in comes to buying their food. These are brands that I've tried and the ladies love. Like, they herd me to the pantry. Anyways, budgeting is a major factor with what I can buy for the month, so I created a budget calculator which you can access [<a id="food-calc" href="cat-food-budget.xlsx">here</a>]. I wanted to figure out which cat food products contained the most protien and which 
        ones were the most cost effective per amount. This website is here to collect all that data and compare information in a way that's accessible. After much research, this is what my pantry looks like.
